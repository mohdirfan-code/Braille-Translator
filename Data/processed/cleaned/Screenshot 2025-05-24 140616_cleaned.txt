The silver sphere that was the Marie IV, the balloon of all balloons to Captain
Conway, tugged lightly at the sandbags that held her to the floor. A faint chill
breeze whipped around the corner of the open hangar and swayed her gently; the
grace of the oscillations suggested an eagerness to tear away from the moorings
that lay in a neat square below her basket. Big beyond comparison with other free
balloons, she was an object of affection from airmen. She was not just a free
balloon, a fabrication of cloth and rope and wicker, filled with hydrogen; she was
the Marie IV; her name was painted in tall blue letters on her side beneath the
netting, and men spoke of her by name. To those familiar with her exploits she had
a definite personality, as inanimate things may often have.
In the semi-gloom inside the hangar two men were working. Conway, the larger of
these men, was standing in the wicker car of the balloon. Kisner, his aide on many
past occasions, knelt upon the floor and sorted paraphernalia, pausing, now and
then, to stand and pass some object up to Conway. It was cold; the mercury of the
thermometer in the basket huddled in the tube at ten degrees above zero; both
men wore heavy fur-lined flying clothes, though only Conway was going on the
flight. Their hands were mittened and were huge, like paws; their feet were incased
in awkward fleece-lined moccasins.
Kisner lifted a small steel cylinder, upon which was attached a parachute pack, and
handed it to Conway; the larger man stepped to the opposite side of the wicker cage
and tussled clumsily with the straps and lines that were meant to hold the cylinder
in place against a framework on the outside of the car. His hands were all thumbs,
and he had difficulty. Finally, in exasperation he turned to Kisner.
Here, fella, give me a hand. Ive got too many mittens.
Take em off, Kisner suggested gravely, stepping around the basket. You cant tie
knots in a piece of rope with two thumbs.
