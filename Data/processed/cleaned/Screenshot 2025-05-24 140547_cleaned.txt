again: they knew how much oxygen he carried, how long it would supply him; and
when the time was up, they drove silently from the club to the balloon hangar and
waited there, scanning the sky and hoping desperately to see the balloon
descending near at hand, yet knowing that winds in the upper air were apt to drift
the bag many miles Before it returned to earth. Time passed, and no word came of
it. They waited now apathetically. They were sure that Conway was dead, and
Kisner blamed Welkfurn bitterly.
Why are we waiting here? Welkfurn asked woodenly. The balloon wont come
down around herethe wind will drift it.
All kinds of winds up there. Cant tell where it went. One wind might drift it one
way, then up a little higher another wind might blow it back. Anyhow
Suddenly Welkfurn cried eagerly:
Kisner, look! He pointed up as he spoke, and finally Kisner saw a speck of gray
above another speck of dark, three or four miles to the east. These specks fell
together, rapidly, in a straight line earthward. Kisner, running to his car, obtained
binoculars, focused them quickly.
The basket of the balloon stood out quite plainly through the glass, the bag above it
twisted hopelessly in the netting. There was no one in the car, and fora moment
Kisner hoped that Conway had left his craft when higher up, was somewhere now
coming down dangling on his parachute. The wreck hurtled toward the earth.
Kisner judged that it was at six thousand feet when he first saw it. It reached four,
then three; was plainer to be seen as it descended.
