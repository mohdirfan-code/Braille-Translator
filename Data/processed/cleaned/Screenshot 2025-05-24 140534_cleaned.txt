from the first oxygen tank to the second; then, with a knife that dangled on a string
inside the basket he cut the rubber tubing of the first tank and hacked at the
lashings that protruded into the car. The empty cylinder fell silently away; the
balloon lunged upward gently, hesitated with a slight jerk, then went up again.
Conway was dimly conscious that his radio was silent. He tuned it carefully,
examined it at length without success. Finally he leaned over the side of the basket
and looked down at the antennait was gone. Slowly he scrawled on his log:
Cyl. dropped. Broke antenna off; no more music.
He busied himself for some minutes with entries in his log, writing now in an
unsteady hand, clumsily. He set down the time shown on the clock and the voltage
being drawn from his batteriesanything he saw or anything he thought about
recording to occupy his mind.
Insidiously the numbness grew upon his body. He seemed unable to see his
instruments clearly; he was like a drunken man, his vision blurred. Doggedly he
shook his head, trying thus to clear his sight. His senses seemed all befuddled.
Foolhardy though he knew the expenditure of energy to befor he was not
coldhe took to waving his mittened hands, clapping them together gently, as a
freezing man might do when slipping into a fatal stupor in the cold. But that did no
good; and he took up his pencil again and tried to make another entry in his log.
His mind seemed to work in vagrant opposition to his will, disobeying reason and
experience.
He read his altimeter and his clock and thermometer. These readings he put down
carefully, with painful labor. The altimeter registered thirty-eight thousand feet; it
was three-twenty by the clock; the temperature was down to thirty-four below. He
found the line on the log below where his last entry had been made. There was
something distantly familiar about the figures already there and the ones he was
trying to write; he fumbled in his mind to recall the connectionfailed.
