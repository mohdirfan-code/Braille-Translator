Conway came presently and shoved through the crowd of curious people, climbed
into the basket and put on his fur-lined helmet and his parachute. He made a
last-minute inspection of the oxygen equipment and spoke quietly to Kisner, who
stood close by. He was in a good humor now that the flight was definitely under
way.

“Tell that little cuss I’m going to break his neck when I get down,” he said, referring
to Welkfurn. “Going to get a dub and run him all over this flying field!”

Kisner nodded gravely. He was in no mood for joking. He was tempted to try again
to persuade Conway to postpone the flight, but he knew that it was useless. He
reached up and grasped the furry paw that was extended down to him.

“Good luck, old man,” he said, keeping his voice steady with difficulty. “Call me up
as soon as you get down and I'll come after you.”

“Thanks,” he replied absently.

The Marie took off for altitude at two twenty-three that afternoon. The wind had
died down during the day from a fitful, biting breeze to a dead calm; overhead the
clouds had thickened perceptibly.

The weather was ideal. Cold air, dry and heavy; the balloon would go up into the
higher reaches in a steady climb that would take it to forty thousand feet within an
hour—or sooner, if Conway wanted it.

But Conway had no particular desire for speed. Rather, he wanted to go up slowly
so that the effects of the change of atmospheric pressure on his body would not be
acutely uncomfortable; he wanted to go up slowly, also, so that he might study the
conditions of the air at varying elevations. When once at the top of his climb, with
the record his, he wanted to remain there several minutes—as long as his oxygen
supply would permit—to study the conditions there. For while he wanted the
